A modification of SDLPoP 1.21 that aims to better emulate the PC-98 and X68000 ports of Prince 1.

Currently, it features:
-Ambient and combat music in all levels, with the track order matching the two ports.
-A few new jingles (example: the tune that plays after the level exit door finishes opening)
-Freeroam tickrate close to that of the PC-98 version's default speed setting (combat tickrate still matches IBM PC version).

To do:
-Fix any newly introduced bugs.
-Support the PC-98/X68000 port graphical assets and rework the engine to work with a 640x400 drawing window.
-Add the PC-98 speed settings.
-Port the intro sequences.
-Rework the Jaffar fight.

Special thanks to mk1994 for testing and assisting in coding.
